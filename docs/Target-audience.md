Millennial Buyers Expect Speed, Simplicity

When it comes to B2B solutions, there are two common expectations that Millennial buyers have for the product/service that they are shopping for: Simplicity and speed. This year’s Content Preferences survey shows that Millennial buyers prefer case studies (73%) over any other content type, proving that they are looking for real-life examples and results from using particular solutions.

“Millennials are not afraid of complex technology; they just want to find a simple solution to their problems,” said Erika Goldwater, VP of Marketing at ANNUITAS. “They go in, assess the situation and figure out what needs to be done — in and out. Since the Millennial generation isn’t afraid of technology, it’s pretty easy for Millennial buyers to find a simplified answer to a complex problem.”

The search for a quick, reliable solution also gives Millennial buyers more leeway when making the final decision on what solution is the best fit for their organization. Millennial buyers are more inclined to go through a trial-and-error process when shopping for a solution, compared to older generations who are more likely to work with what they currently have in order to improve efficiency.

Ultimately, Millennials are looking for the connection between a brand’s message and their specific wants and needs. If they do not believe in a company’s message, they are less likely to select that company’s solution as the ultimate answer.

Much like the way shoppers go into the buying process for a new car, B2B Millennial buyers have adopted a self-education process when it comes to their buying behavior,” Masotto said. “With the amount of information that’s available digitally, Millennial buyers don’t interact with sales reps until they have already made their decision.”

Of all the available channels marketers can utilize to engage prospective buyers, social media has become the most effective. The constant connection that is associated with social media — especially when connected through mobile devices — makes it the suitable choice for Millennial buyers to quickly obtain information from several sources.

To successfully engage with this audience, marketers need to make sure that their social media posts align with every other team in the organization in order to supply a consistent message across all channels.

“Everything that you share via social media should align with everything that is going on internally within your company,”
